MagicEraser - Telegram Bot for removing objects from pictures

Just send two photos: 
First photo is the original image
Second one - original image with some drawings on it (Telegram has a built-in drawing tool)
The second one should be sent as a reply to the first one

And you should be good to go! Feel free to fork and submit pull requests. Thanks!
